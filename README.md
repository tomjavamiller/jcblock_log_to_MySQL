# jcblock_log_to_MySQL
Get and parse jcblock's callerid log file and import into MySQL DB

# Technologies Used
Python3 sqlalchemy

# Reason
While I have jcblock running at my house, the phone company will block up to 25 
phone numbers for me, therefore with this script, I can quickly add the caller id's to the database and 
display the most likely numbers that I should add, if any.
